# mnemonic-reader

PDF reader/highlighter with spaced repetition flash cards, inspired by the work of [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/) and [Micheal Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/).

The aim is to make a downloadable app (using Electron/Python) that allows you to read and annotate PDFs, creating annotation-linked flash cards as you go.
